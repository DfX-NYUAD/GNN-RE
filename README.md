### Overview 
GNN-RE is a generic, graph neural network (GNN)-based platform for functional reverse engineering of circuits. GNN-RE (i) represents and analyzes flattened/ unstructured gate-level netlists, (ii) automatically identifies the boundaries between the modules or sub-circuits implemented in such netlists, and (iii) classifies the sub-circuits based on their functionalities.
